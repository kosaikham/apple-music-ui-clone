# Apple Music UI Clone

It only includes a bit of animation of Apple Music App. This is one of my practicing repo to improve layout position and animation in React Native.

## Built With

- [React Native](https://facebook.github.io/react-native/) - a JavaScript framework for writing real, natively rendering mobile applications for iOS and Android
- [Expo](https://expo.io/)[Tools] - It allows you to start a project without installing or configuring any tools to build native code - no Xcode or Android Studio installation required

## Demo

3. Install the [Expo](https://expo.io) client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.
